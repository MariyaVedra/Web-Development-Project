    <h3>What is minecraft?</h3>
    <p>
      Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios.<br>
      Markus "Notch" Persson designed the game using the Java programming language.<br>
      It was first made public in May 2009, after numerous early private testing versions, before being completely released in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development.<br>
     Minecraft is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and about 140 million monthly active users as of 2021.
